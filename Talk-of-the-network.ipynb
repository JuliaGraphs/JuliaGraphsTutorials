    "In [Talk of the Network](https://www0.gsb.columbia.edu/mygsb/faculty/research/pubfiles/3391/TalkofNetworks.pdf), the authors  explore the pattern of personal communication betwee an individual's core friends group (strong ties) and a wider set of acquaintances (weak ties). This remarkable study is one of the first ones in marketing that explored the influence of social networks on the diffusion of marketing messages. The key questions investigated in the context of information dissemination are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- What matters more - strong ties or weak ties?\n",
    "- What effect does the size of an average individuals network have?\n",
    "- How does advertising interact with the diffusion through weak ties and that through strong ties\n",
